Consider the 4D polytope (4D equivalent of a polyhedron) of the 16-cell. It has 8 vertices, and 32 faces, and hence 32 face centers. You can partition these face centers into 32/8 = 4 groups, each with 8 points, so that each group consists of the vertices of a rotated 16-cell. When we construct all these rotated polytopes, we have a compound of four 16-cells. The vertices of this compound are the face centers of the original 16-cell. This compound is not regular because it's not face transitive. This construction works for the 16-cell, the 24-cell, and the 600-cell, with face or edge centers. It does not work for the 5-cell, the 8-cell, or the 120-cell.

See some pictures of these compounds here. The original polytope is white and the rotated ones are colored. Go to https://observablehq.com/@nanma80/polytope-compounds-based-on-face-and-edge-centers to see interactive visualization, where you can choose to hide some components and perform rotation.
