# 4D polytope compounds with vertices on edge/face/cell centers

| Generated by  | Edge centers  | Face centers  | Cell centers  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16-cell  | 24/8=3, nonchiral  | 32/8=4, chiral  | 16/8=2, nonchiral  |
| 24-cell  | 96/24=4, chiral  | 96/24=4, nonchiral  | 24/24=1, self-dual, nonchiral  |
| 600-cell  | 720/120=6, chiral | 1200/120=10, chiral  | 600/120=5, chiral  |

5-cell, 8-cell, and 120-cell don't have such configurations.
